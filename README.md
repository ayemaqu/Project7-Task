# Project 7 - *Task*

Submitted by: **Ayema Qureshi**

**Task** is an app that is a checklist of tasks for you to keep track of

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] App displays a list of tasks
- [X] Users can add tasks to the list
- [X] Session persists when application is closed and relaunched (tasks dont get deleted when closing app) 
  - [X] Note: You have to quit the app, not minimize it, in order to see the persistence.
- [X] Tasks can be deleted
- [X] Users have a calendar view via navigation controller that displays tasks    


The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Tasks can be toggled completed
- [X] User can edit tasks by tapping on the task in the feed view
- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
    - I added a progress bar. Each time you completed a task, the bar progresses, and if you uncheck it it will degress.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I struggled to understand the syntax on UserDefaults and understanding how the task model entirely works.
